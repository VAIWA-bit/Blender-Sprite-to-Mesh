# Blender: Sprite to Mesh
![prev](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VAIWA-bit/Blender-Sprite-to-Mesh/refs/heads/main/PREV.jpg)
## You can use this tool to convert sprites(images/textures) to 3D mesh
## Info
- Tested in Blender 4.1, 4.2
- Change View Transform to Raw (Render->Color Management)
- Toggle System Console to track import progress (Window->Toggle System Console)
- The app is built using **Microsoft Edge WebView2**. If you don't have it, you will need to install it (It comes pre-installed by default on Windows 10 and later)
## 1. Download SpriteToMesh.zip and open it
## 2. Open image and click EXPORT button
The program will create python script in the same folder where SpriteToMesh.exe is located

**Tip 1:** Use small resolution sprites because each pixel will be represented as plane with material, for instance 16x16 image will result in 256 planes and 256 materials (16*16=256)
## 3. Open Blender and run the output python script
- Switch to text editor, open the python script or click create new, copy and paste the script and click run button
